This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Introduction


## Concept

I decided to focus mainly on cats and r/cats - mostly because I didn't have any other original ideas. It eventually ended up a little childish, but I think in general design-wise it looks pretty good.

## Features

List of features

## Features I'd like to implement
A working searchbar
Some more interactivity (if possible using the unofficial API)

## Known Bugs
Search Bar does not work properly
If using a very small mobile view, comments can overflow off the sides
